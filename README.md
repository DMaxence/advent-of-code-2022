# advent-of-code-2022

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

> You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

I'll write my answers in plain Javascript as it's the quickest for me, but you can use the logic in every other languages!

## How to use

1. Clone the repo
2. Make sure you are running Node.js version `17.5` or more recent.
3. Go to the folder of the day you want to run `cd d[XX]`
4. Run `node d[XX].js` in the terminal to run the code for the day XX.

## Disclaimer

The answers are probably not the best nor the most efficient. These are the one I came up with without seeking for performance.

There are a lot of different ways to solve the problems so you should not take my answers as the only way to solve them.
